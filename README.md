## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Choose the answer for 5 questions
- Get a score based on their performance on the quiz

## My process

The challenge in this project was figuring our how to display the feedback on the answers once they were submitted by the user. I decided that i would create new properties in each of the question returned by the API to keep track of the answer selected by the user to campare it with the correct answer contained in the data. Everytime the user selects an answer, the value of the answer will be stored in a property inside the question objects in the data to keep track of it. New properties will be created to keep track of the right of wrong answers as well.

Another challenge in the projects was to randomize the values of the answers in each queastion object since they always come in the same order everytime. This is solved with a function I created called setRandomAnswers wich basically creates an array with indexes, then chooses a random index from thath array, this random index is then used to grab one value from an array that contains all answers in order, then I erase the index used so the function doesnt return the same value.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I made this project maninly as a refresher for my react knowledge and improvemnet of my programming logic.

### Continued development

I look forward to create more simple apps like this one because they are very helpful when it comes to consolidate knowledge.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
