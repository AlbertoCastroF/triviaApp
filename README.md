## My process

The first thing i had to think about was how many pages i would need to use since you have to be able to see the detail of each country. After deciding it would be two, i chose to use one single file to store all the logic using useContext hook, then, added styles using styled components.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

This is the first project where i have to implement BrowserRouter and useEffect hook. It was interesting figuring out the way to use router with useParams even though the project only has 2 pages, i have a better understanding on how it can be used on multiple pages site. I had some troubles with the dependencies array in the useEffect hook for fetching data the first time the site loads but i learned that you need to let useEffect know about all the data inside it from the render component to keep all data synchronized.

### Continued development

I read that Reducers can prevent the use of dependencies in useEffect since you can use an action to reference an operation with values in the render component so id like to use them in my next react project.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
